A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, an A/B test was performed on sample data for an e-commerce website.  
the goal is to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage, 
- Keep the old webpage, or 
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
This project demonstrates the understanding and application of three methods to perform the same task where these methods confirm the results obtained and offer extra exploraion options
The methods used are
1- Hypothesis testing
2- Z-Testing
3- Logistic Regression
